Today, I gave an oral presentation at the National Conference for Undergraduate 
Research 2025 in Pittsburgh on phase transitions in the 4-Level qudit projective 
transverse-field Ising model. While I was there, I also took the time to tour
Carnegie Mellon University, including the School of Computer Science!
