### Phase Transitions in Projective Transverse Field Ising Models *(2024 - )*
**Keywords**: [Keyword1, Keyword2]

**Mentor**: Dr. Nat Tantivasadakarn (California Institute of Technology) 

**Description**:
Entanglement serves as a robust measure for characterizing transitions between topological phases. These transitions frequently arise in the 1D projective transverse field Ising model (PTIM), a quantum variant of the classical Ising model wherein nearest-neighbor and external field interactions correspond to stochastic projective measurements of Pauli $$ZZ$$ and $X$ on a qubit chain. In this study, we extend the PTIM to 4-level qudit chains featuring three non-commuting generalized Pauli operators to identify novel entanglement transitions. We efficiently simulate entanglement dynamics via a cluster model whose runtime scales linearly with system size. By averaging the entanglement entropy and mutual information across thousands of quantum trajectories for different probabilities of the three measurement types, we demonstrate the existence of three distinct entanglement phases whose transition lines meet at a critical point along the boundary of the phase diagram. Moreover, we illustrate that the scaling prefactor of the entanglement entropy along the transition lines is equivalent to that of the qubit model along all points except for the critical point, where this value doubles. We corroborate this by demonstrating that the averaged entanglement quantities computed for two coupled qubit PTIMs are identical to those of the 4-level qudit model. Future work will involve an alternative derivation of these observations from a conformal field theory perspective via a mapping to bond percolation. Furthermore, we suggest investigating the applications of these results to quantum error correction schemes in the context of syndrome measurements and projective errors.

### Prof. Yu Tong, Assistant Professor of Mathematics, Duke University (2025 - )

Since January 2025, I have been studying Hamiltonian testing and learning 
protocols with the aim of constructing an algorithm that performs
Hamiltonian sparsity testing with Heisenberg-limited scaling.

### Dr. Nat Tantivasadakarn, Sherman Fairchild Postdoctoral Scholar Research Associate in Theoretical Physics, California Institute of Technology (2024 - )

My first exposure to quantum information theory research was under Dr. Nat Tantivasadakarn.
Since the summer of 2024, I have been working on a project studying phase
transitions in the $\mathbb Z_4$ projective transverse-field Ising model.
