## Education is Not a Privilege. It’s a Right.  

In today’s world, **access to knowledge determines opportunity**. 
Yet, for millions, wealth remains a gatekeeper. University tuition, 
expensive textbooks, and exclusive courses lock away critical skills 
and ideas behind paywalls, deepening inequality in the process.  

**Education should not be a luxury**. It is the foundation of progress, 
the engine of innovation, and the only true path to empowerment.  

### My Mission: Tear Down the Barriers  
I refuse to accept a world where financial status dictates intellectual growth. 
That’s why I’ve dedicated my work to **providing free, high-quality lectures** 
on a wide variety of subjects in 
computer science and physics, which I have posted on my YouTube channel 
[VarPi](https://www.youtube.com/@VarPi-d7t), democratizing learning for anyone 
with an internet connection. No fees. No gatekeeping. Just **knowledge for all**.
