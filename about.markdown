I am an undergraduate student at Caltech majoring in computer science in physics,
graduating in June 2026.

I have a research experience in quantum computation, quantum algorithms, and
quantum information theory, which I have explored through my work under
Dr. (Nat Tantivasadakarn)(https://www.pma.caltech.edu/people/nathanan-nat-tantivasadakarn)
and Professor [Yu Tong](https://ece.duke.edu/people/yu-tong/) 
(see "Research" for more information).
I am also aiming to do a senior thesis under Professor Preskill over the academic
year 2025-2026.

Outside of research, I have also dabbled in teaching experience, which I have
explored via both by serving as a teaching assistant for various introductory
CS courses as well as by developing a wide array of high-quality lectures
on popular topics based on my university curriculum.
