## Academic Background

I am an undergraduate student at Caltech majoring in computer science in physics,
graduating in June 2026.

I have a research experience in quantum computation, quantum algorithms, and
quantum information theory, which I have explored through my work under
[Professor Nat Tantivasadakarn](https://www.pma.caltech.edu/people/nathanan-nat-tantivasadakarn) 
(now at Stony Brook University) and [Professor Yu Tong](https://ece.duke.edu/people/yu-tong/) 
(see "Research" for more information).

I will be doing a senior thesis under [Professor John Preskill](https://www.preskill.caltech.edu/) over the academic
year 2025-2026.

Outside of research, I have thoroughly explored teaching, which I have
done both by serving as a teaching assistant for various introductory
CS courses as well as by developing a wide array of high-quality lectures
on popular topics based on my university curriculum.
